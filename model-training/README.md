# Haggis Recognition Model Training

This repo contains a script to train a state-of-the-art image recognition model to detect a haggis using Keras, Tensorflow and FloydHub.

To train the model on a GPU on FloydHub, simply clone this repository locally, install the `floyd-cli`, initialize a project on FloydHub and type `run` command into your terminal:

```$ floyd run```

Alternatively, you can launch a FloydHub Workspace by clicking the button below and then run the `training.py` script through the Jupyter Lab environment:
